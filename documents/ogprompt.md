Check the @documents/ - I have provided you with everything you need to build an AI agent using A2A protocol. I want to only build the A2A server and not a client. I want to phase this out and build a simple agent first. I have already created the project directory structure- the python files are empty but you will use the same structure. Install dependancies from @pyproject.toml. You have to use the Python SDK fot A2A 0.3.0. Here's how I want you to phase things: -
- Phase- 1 - Build a simple agent that responds to a message with a task, uses Claude API for the llm (API key is stored in @.env). The agent has basic A2A requirements like agent-card (@agentcard.json ), adherence to JSON RPC etc. All the specifications are here - @A2A_specification.md and @A2A.md. The agent should be able to use Claude to respond to messages. No tools, streaming, state management here. 
- Phase- 2 - Handle proper task lifecycle of the agent with task history, state management and context for multi-turn conversations - especially using input-required. This is when the agent should be able to have mult-threaded conversations by leveraging the LLM and managing state and context. By the end of this phase all JSON RPC methods should be supported apart from message/stream and tasks/resubscribe
- Phase - 3 - Once multi-turn is working end-end with proper state management. Introduce tools that I have described in @agent_requirements.md . Add just one tool in this phase
- Phase - 4 Introduce streaming support with SSE- now all json RPC methods would be supported.
- Phase - 5 - Add more tools
- Phase - 6 - Add support for attachments with file-part in addition to text-part
- Phase - 7 Generate artifacts
- Phase - 8 - Anything else that is remaining.

Things to remember for all phases. The code has to be simple and clean without any shortcuts, hardcoding or anti-patterns. You should use the Python SDK for A2A implementation and not use custom code. The agent should be LLM-driven and not rely on a lot of custom logic. The job of the code is to ensure the LLM always has the proper state and context. Don't take shortcuts and use the A2A specifications whenever in doubt. Ask clarifying questions whenever you are stuck. Last but most important. Every phase to be tested end-end before moving on to the next phase. Make a copy of these instructions and use it as context in all of your next steps. Create a plan for phase-1 and get it approved by me

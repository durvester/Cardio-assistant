## üìã Conversation 1: Multi-Turn Referral Workflow

**Scenario:** Step-by-step referral collection process  
**Expected Behavior:** Agent guides user through complete referral process  
**Final State:** `input-required` (still collecting information)

### Turn 1: Initial Request
**üë§ User:** I need a cardiology referral

**ü§ñ Agent:** Hello! I'll help you process a cardiology referral to Dr. Walter Reed. Let's start with the essential patient information.

Please provide:
1. Patient's full legal name
2. Date of birth (MM/DD/YYYY)

- Clear, structured request ‚úÖ
- Appropriate scope (cardiology focus) ‚úÖ
- Good use of numbered lists ‚úÖ

### Turn 2: Patient Information
**üë§ User:** Patient: Maria Rodriguez, DOB 05/15/1980, MRN 67890, phone 555-1234

**ü§ñ Agent:** Thank you for providing the patient information for Maria Rodriguez. Now, I need details about the referring provider to properly document the referral source.

Please provide:
1. Referring physician's full name and credentials (MD, DO, etc.)
2. Provider's NPI (National Provider Identifier) number
3. Practice or organization name
4. Provider's contact information (office phone/fax)

Once you share these provider details, we can move on to discussing Ms. Rodriguez's clinical information and reason for the cardiology referral.

### Turn 3: Provider Information
**üë§ User:** Referring physician: Dr. Sarah Johnson, NPI 1234567890, from Heart Care Medical Group

**ü§ñ Agent:** Thank you for the referring provider information. Now, I need to collect important clinical information about Ms. Rodriguez to ensure appropriate cardiology care.

Please provide:
1. Primary cardiac complaint/reason for referral
2. Any relevant cardiac history
3. Current cardiac medications (if any)
4. Recent test results (such as EKG, echo, stress test, or relevant labs)
5. How long has she been experiencing symptoms, and how severe are they?

This information is crucial for Dr. Reed to properly evaluate the urgency of the referral and prepare for the consultation.

Also, I notice we're missing the referring provider's office phone/fax number - we'll need that as well to complete the referral.

### Turn 4: Clinical Information
**üë§ User:** Clinical: Patient has chest pain for 2 weeks, takes metoprolol, recent EKG shows abnormal rhythm

**ü§ñ Agent:** Thank you for the clinical information. Given the chest pain and abnormal EKG, we'll need to prioritize this referral appropriately. Before we can schedule Ms. Rodriguez with Dr. Reed, I need her insurance information to ensure proper coverage and determine if prior authorization is required.

Please provide:
1. Insurance provider name
2. Member ID number
3. Group number
4. Any existing authorization number (if already obtained)

Once you provide the insurance details, we can proceed with scheduling her appointment. Given her symptoms, we'll aim to get her seen as soon as possible.

Note: I'm also still missing Dr. Johnson's office contact information (phone/fax), which we'll need for proper communication of appointment details and medical records.

**‚úÖ Quality Assessment:**
- Recognizes clinical urgency (chest pain + abnormal EKG) ‚úÖ
- Appropriate prioritization logic ‚úÖ
- Insurance coverage awareness ‚úÖ
- Persistent about missing information ‚úÖ
- Shows clinical judgment ("as soon as possible") ‚úÖ
